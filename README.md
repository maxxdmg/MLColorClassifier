# MLColorClassifier
Using machine learning to classify colors as 1 of 9 colors i.e. "red-ish". Uses tensorflow.js and a mass amount of data aggregated by TheCodingTrain which is used to train the model. Currently runs with 10 epochs after completion a user is able to customize an rgb value and see what the model classifies it as.
This is my first attempt at machine learning so it definitely could use some optimization, however the UI is what needs the biggest touch up.
Nothing additional is required to run, just download the files and execute index.html
